        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>
        <p>It is WAWS Media’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
          our website.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://wawsmedia.vercel.app/">https://wawsmedia.vercel.app/</a>.</p>
        <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide
          us through the Website.</p>
        <p>We have adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on our
          Website,</p>
        <p>how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our
          collection of information from other sources.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
          rules and policies governing your use of our Website.</p>
        <p>Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and
          conditions.</p>

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>Like most website operators, WAWS Media collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
          browsers and servers typically make available,</p>
        <p>such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
        </p>
        <p>WAWS Media’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
          WAWS Media’s visitors use its website.</p>
        <p>From time to time, WAWS Media may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
          publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
        <p>WAWS Media also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
          for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a
            href="https://wawsmedia.vercel.app/">https://wawsmedia.vercel.app/</a> blog posts.</p>
        <p>WAWS Media only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
          and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to WAWS Media’s websites choose to interact with WAWS Media in ways that require WAWS Media
          to gather personally-identifying information.</p>
        <p>The amount and type of information that WAWS Media gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.</p>
        <p>For example, we may ask visitors who sign up for a blog at <a
            href="https://wawsmedia.vercel.app/">https://wawsmedia.vercel.app/</a> to provide a username and email address.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
          over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
        <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
          guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
        <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.</p>
        <p>These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement
          to compile information about you or others who use your computer.</p>
        <p>This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe
          will be of most interest to you.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by WAWS Media and does not cover the use of cookies by any
          advertisers.</p>

        <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us.</p>
        <p>If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site.</p>
        <p>We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
          third-party sites, products or services.</p>

        <h2>Site May use Google AdWords for Remarketing</h2>
        <p><a href="https://wawsmedia.vercel.app/">https://wawsmedia.vercel.app/</a> may use the remarketing services to
          advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site.</p>
        <p>It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example
          using the contact form to make an inquiry.</p>
        <p>This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page or a site in the Google
          Display Network.</p>
        <p>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits.</p>
        <p>Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy
          policy.</p>
        <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page,</p>
        <p>and if you want to you can opt-out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently
          using a browser plugin.</p>

          the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
          users.</p>

          alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
